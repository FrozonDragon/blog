You are very unhappy about the situation because it disturbs the peace of the neighborhood. Write a letter to your local government official. Say who you are and explain why you are unhappy and suggest what should be done about it.</strong></p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,<br><strong>I’m writing to express my dissatisfaction with the horrible situation</strong> I have been faced with recently.</p>
<p>I’m a resident of Rose Park on St. Johnson Street. I had been enjoying my life since I moved here five years ago. ++However++, a nightclub recently opened right across the street from my apartment block has completely changed everything.</p>
<p>++To begin with++, the club itself is very unsightly. It has blackened windows with sexually explicit pictures displayed on the outside, which I find extremely offensive. ++Also++, the noise level during the early hours of the morning is so intense that it has really disturbed my sleep. ++Consequently++, I find that I am unable to concentrate fully on my job, as I am often too tired.</p>
<p>I work as a surgeon in the local hospital; therefore, I am sure you can <strong>see the gravity of my complaint</strong>. ++Indeed++, the consequences of my making any mistake due to my lack of sleep can be very serious indeed.</p>
<p>I understand that, as a member of the local government, you have the power to close the club down. ++Nevertheless++, I know very clearly that people need to make a living and I would not like to be responsible for people losing their jobs. ++Hence++, if you could please ensure that the offensive pictures are removed, and the noise level is kept to a minimum level, I would be more than satisfied.</p>
<p>I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Kenny Gao</p>

<h3 id="投诉信-1"><a href="#投诉信-1" class="headerlink" title="投诉信"></a>投诉信</h3><p><strong>You have recently made a purchase from the local department store. However, when you arrived home, you found a faultwith it. Write a letter to the manager, say what the product is, explain the problem and say what you’d like to be done about it. </strong></p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,<br><strong>I’m writing to complain about</strong> the recent purchase of a woolen sweater from your department store on Philip Street, on August 25, 2007.</p>
<p>I recently washed the sweater in cool water, as per the instructions on the label. ++However++, when I removed it from the machine, the garment was stretchedout of shape and no longer fits.</p>
<p>I phoned the store last Tuesday (June 21) and spoke to the department manager, a Mr. Morris, who was rather rude on the phone and informed me that I could not get a replacement sweater as it was purchased at a reduced price. I felt really upset, for I have been a loyal customer of your store for many years and until this incident, never have had any complaints. I, ++therefore++, <strong>feel disappointed to be treated in such a manner</strong>.</p>
<p>I would, however, be perfectlysatisfied if you would kindly replace the sweater or refund my money, whichever is more convenient.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>Yours truly,<br>Kenny Gao</p>

Write a letter to the immigration officer of this country to ask about, say who you are and explain your qualifications and experience.</strong></p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam,<br>　　<strong>I would like to receive information regarding</strong> the immigration procedures to Canada.</p>
<p>　　I am 34 years old and am currently working as senior mechanical engineer at ABC Tech Company in Shanghai. I hold a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree from Shanghai Tongji University. I am married and my wife will be having our first child this coming autumn.</p>
<p>　　I have been considering immigrating to Canada for quiet some time and would like to know if my qualifications and work experience make me eligible to apply. I have enclosed my resume as well as a bank statement of my current financial status and my English proficiency level.</p>
<p>　　I’d also like to know if my wife and I can make one application, or whether we’ll have to apply separately. ++In addition++, if you could send me information regarding permanent residence in Canada, I’d be most grateful.</p>
<p>　　I look forward to receiving the information <strong>at your earliest convenience</strong>.<br>　　Yours truly,<br>　　Kenny Gao</p>

<h3 id="问询信-1"><a href="#问询信-1" class="headerlink" title="问询信"></a>问询信</h3><p><strong>　　You are going to an overseas university to study. Write a letter to the university asking about accommodation and airport pickup.</strong></p>
<p>　　Dear Ms. Morris,<br>　　I’m writing to inquire about some information regarding accommodation at your university and the airport pickup issue.</p>
<p>　　I’m a mature, female student and would prefer, as far as possible, to share some accommodation with other mature female students, preferably in a quiet location. However, I have no objection to living on campus as long as it is quiet enough for me to study. I’m also a non-smoker and would prefer to share with other non-smokers although this is a preference rather than a request.</p>
<p>　　I will arrive in London on August 26 from Shanghai and would be very grateful if you could send someone to pick me up or, at the least, send me the details of how to get to the university by myself from London Heathrow Airport, as this will be my first time to the UK.</p>
<p>　　I’m looking forward to receiving your reply and meeting you in person in September.<br>　　Yours sincerely,<br>　　Susan Gao</p>

<h3 id="推荐信"><a href="#推荐信" class="headerlink" title="推荐信"></a>推荐信</h3><p><strong>　　Someone you know well is applying to a university abroad. Write a recommendationletter for him, say how you got to know him and why he is worth your recommendation. </strong></p>
<p>　　Dear Sir or Madam,<br>　　I’m writing to recommend to you the outstanding personality and the super ability for learning of Mr. Robert Jiang.  </p>
<p>　　I got to know Mr. Jiang a few years ago while I was teaching British literature to a class of English majors in which he was a student. His excellent performances on several occasions such as group discussions and open debate really took me by great surprise. Never had I met a young student speaking English so fluently and accurately. His insight into British literature as a whole as well as the perspectives he cut into the analysis of characters in the literature aroused my great curiosity about his first-class and unique capability of doing research work. Later on, upon his completion of the Bachelor degree, he moved on to pursue his study for a Master’s degree in the same field of study and I was very lucky to be his supervisor. Mr. Jiang has always been an honest person. He is very friendly to people and is very easy-going. Many of his classmates have mentioned on different occasions about how helpful he was to them and to which I simply cannot agree more.</p>
<p>　　Now Mr. Jiang is applying to your prestigious university for a chance to continue his Ph.D research. I hope you’ll find he is just as good as I’m now recommendinghim to be. And should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me at the following e-mail address:……</p>
<p>　　Truly yours<br>　　Kenny Gao </p>

<h3 id="推荐信-1"><a href="#推荐信-1" class="headerlink" title="推荐信"></a>推荐信</h3><p><strong>　　You are asked to write a recommendation letter for someone you know well. Say who you are, how you got to know him or her, and why he or she is worth your recommendation. </strong></p>
<p>　　Dear Sir or Madam,<br>　　I’m writing to recommend to you the outstanding personality of Miss Jiang Junlei. </p>
<p>　　I got to know Miss Jiang in 2002 while I was giving a placement test to a group of candidates who applied to our daytime English Intensive Training Program. It happened that she was in the group and she impressed me greatly with her friendly and lovely smile throughout the test. In the following year, while I was organizing a summer camp program with the participation of about 600 high school students coming from all parts of China, I immediately thought of her. The reason was very simple: she is kind, friendly, patient, helpful and loving, thus well suiting a position as class teacher. Besides, she had some experience in hospital nursing which made my choice of her more reasonable and she proved to me as well as to all my colleagues at the camp that my decision was just too perfect. In fact, I was quite surprised by her interpersonal communication skills with both the students and their parents though she was very young herself at the time.</p>
<p>　　After the summer camp, she told me that she would go to either Britain or Ireland to study for her bachelor’s degree. I wished her all the best and there she went. We have kept in touch regularly since then through e-mails. Last May, when she broke for the summer vacation, she came to my new department, Onlytoya IELTS &amp;TOEFL Training Centre, to help me with some management and student consulting work. She drafted three cooperation agreements for me, wrote a dozen articles that we used on our website, gave numerous placement tests to our students, and gave an open lecture on studying and living in Ireland to about 400 Toya students. She was very well accepted by all Toya staff members and our students as well and became, indeed, an indispensable assistant to me. Something well worth mentioning from my academic perspective as professor in English linguistics and American literature is that her English was fluent and accurate, which convinced me that she is all quick to learn anything new. She told me that she often helps do quite some organization work at her university and at the Chinese Embassy in Ireland and had done a lot of traveling in Europe. Obviously, these experiences have greatly broadened her vision and enriched her life, making such a valuable asset in every field of work she is going to perform.<br>　<br>　　All in all, it is both my pleasure and honorto write this recommendation letter for Miss Jiang and I guarantee the truthfulness of all that I have said about her.</p>
<p>　　Should you have any further inquiries, please feel free to contact me either by e-mail or phone at the following address and number:……</p>
<p>　　Yours sincerely,<br>　　Susan Gao</p>

<h3 id="建议信"><a href="#建议信" class="headerlink" title="建议信"></a>建议信</h3><p><strong>A hotel you stayed in recently asked guests to write to the manager and suggest ways in which they could improve their service. Write a letter to the manager, explain who you are, say what you liked about the hotel, and suggest ways in which they could be improved.</strong><br>　　<br>　　Dear Manager,<br>　　I’m writing in response to your invitation to guests who have recently stayed at your hotel to suggest ways in which you could further improve your service.</p>
<p>　　I was a guest at your hotel last month and I found that the level of customer service was excellent. Indeed, every member of your staff, from the manager to the room-cleaning maid, was, without exception, extremely polite and helpful. The standard of the rooms was far beyond what I had expected. </p>
<p>　　However, I found that the hotel restaurant stopped serving breakfast at 8:30am. As I was on holiday, I would have liked to take my breakfast at around 9:30, thus I was unable to do so. I also spoke to several other guests who expressed the same disappointment. In addition, I feel that if you could supply newspapers in Chinese, the quality of stay for Chinese speakers, of whom the number has been on a steady rise in the past few years, would be considerably enhanced.</p>
<p>　　I would be happy to know if my suggestions have turned out to be useful in your constant improvement of your overall service.</p>
<p>　　Looking forward to your reply.<br>　　Yours faithfully,<br>　　Kenny Gao </p>

<h3 id="建议信-1"><a href="#建议信-1" class="headerlink" title="建议信"></a>建议信</h3><p><strong>　　You have a friend who is about to enter university and he wants you to advise him on which subject to specialize in. He is very interested in history, but computer science offers better job prospects. Write a letter to give him some advices.</strong></p>
<p>　　Dear Jack,<br>　　You have asked me for my advice concerning whether you should study history or computer science at university and now I am trying to give you some useful suggestions.</p>
<p>　　You must keep in mind that, above all, your university training is a preparation for your future career. Therefore, your first consideration should be to study a subject which will best equip you to earn a living. There is no doubt that the field of computer offers far wider job opportunities than history.</p>
<p>　　Besides, we are now in the age of a Hi-tech revolution. In the foreseeable future, not only will it be necessary for everyone to be computer-literate, it will also be necessary for him to be equipped with computer skills merely to earn a living! History, I’m afraid, however fascinating it may be, offers few career prospects.</p>
<p>　　Of course, you don’t have to devote all your time at university to studying computers and nothing else. On the contrary, I would recommend that you keep up your reading of history in your spare time. In that way, you will find that your leisure hours are enriched while you prepare yourself for a worthwhile career in computers. </p>
<p>　　Hope you find these suggestions useful in helping you make your decision.</p>
<p>　　Yours sincerely,<br>　　Kenny Ga</p>

<p>　　Dear Sir or Madam,<br>　　I’m writing in response to the advertisement you placed in Chicago Newsdaily for a librarian on Monday, Aug. 23.</p>
<p>　　I graduated with a Master’s degree in telecommunications in 1992 and began my career at California State University as a young teacher. In 2002, I was promoted to associate professor and Deputy Director of the Department of Telecom Engineering.</p>
<p>　　In the past ten years, I have been actively involved in academic researches and have published several articles in “Telecom Now”, “Engineering Research” and “Telecom Strategies”. I also teach marketing strategies on a part-time basis at the university.</p>
<p>　　However, my husband has recently been relocated to Chicago by his company and I am, therefore, seeking a position in the same area in Chicago.</p>
<p>　　I have enclosed my resume that outlines in detail my qualifications and experience as well as an open letter of recommendation from California State University.</p>
<p>　　Please give me a feedback at your earliest convenience if my qualifications meet your requirements.</p>

<h3 id="日常信"><a href="#日常信" class="headerlink" title="日常信"></a>日常信</h3><p>　　<strong>You are writing your first letter to a pen pal. Introduce yourself and tell her that you will be visiting her country during the summer vacation and suggest meeting her.</strong><br>　　<br>　　Dear Sue,<br>　　How are you? I obtained your name and address from Pen Pal International. I am very glad to write to you and we become pen pals.<br>　　<br>　　Let me first introduce myself. I’m currently working as an English teacher at Shanghai Onlytoya College. I graduated from Shanghai Foreign Languages University in 1988, majoring in English literature and linguistics. I got my Master’s degree in pragmatics in 1998. I like playing erhu (a kind of Chinese musical instrument) and listening to pop music. I am also very interested in traveling. Oh, yes, I am a great bar-goer!</p>
<p>　　This summer, I will be traveling to Australia. I will be attending a conference on behalf of my college in Sydney from July 10 to 16. After the conference, I plan to do some sightseeing in Australia, maybe five more days. If you are free, I would be very happy to meet you in person. Perhaps we could have lunch together.</p>
<p>　　Well, let me finish here. I am already eagerly awaitingyour reply to this first letter. Please tell me all about yourself and your interests. I hope we can become good friends.</p>
<p>　　Yours truly,<br>　　Kenny Gao</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="日常信-1"><a href="#日常信-1" class="headerlink" title="日常信"></a>日常信</h3><p><strong>　　A friend of yours is going to your home city for a conference. He will spend a few days there. He has written you a letter, asking for advice about things to see and to do while he is there. Write a letter to him and give him some advice.</strong></p>
<p>　　Dear Mr. More,<br>　　Thank you for your letter dated August 23, 2006. I was very pleased to learn that you will be visiting Shanghai from September 25 to 30. I hope the following information will help you enjoy your stay in my hometown.</p>
<p>　　First of all, Shanghai is a big and busy city. There are many internationalquality hotels and restaurants as well as shopping centers and entertainmentplaces.</p>
<p>　　However, I think you would like to see some interesting places that well represent the city. I know you are interested in art and history, so firstly, I suggest you visit Shanghai Museum, one of the biggest in China.</p>
<p>　　Secondly, not far from the museum is the famous Bund, where you will also have a wonderful view of Pudong: the OrientalPearl TV Tower, and Jinmao Tower—the third highest building in the world! You will see people from all over the world touring around the Bund.</p>
<p>　　Other interesting places are Suzhou—a beautiful city that is famous for its gardens; Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, which is very famous for its West Lake. If you would like to see an old-fashioned village with the most distinctivefeatures of the region of waters in the Changjiang River Delta, I will highly recommend Zhouzhuang, which is about a one-hour drive from Shanghai.</p>
<p>　　I hope these suggestion ns will be helpful. As you only have a short stay in Shanghai, you probably will not be able to do much more sightseeing. But if I can help in any other way, please let me know.</p>
<p>　　Looking forward to meeting you here in Shanghai!<br>　　Yours sincerely,<br>　　Kenny Gao</p>

<h3 id="谢绝信"><a href="#谢绝信" class="headerlink" title="谢绝信"></a>谢绝信</h3><p><strong>　　Your friend is getting married and he has invited you to his wedding. However, you can’t make it for a certain reason. Now write a letter to explain why.</strong></p>
<p>　　Dear Steve and Monica,<br>　　Thank you very much for the invitation to your wedding. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to attend.</p>
<p>　　The reason, I’m pleased to say, is that Wendy is pregnantand the baby is due more or less on the day of your wedding! Although she said it’d be all right for me to come over alone, I feel it’s the least I could do as husband, that is, to be by her side and to take care of her after the baby arrives.</p>
<p>　　We’re both hoping it’ll be a girl and plan to name her Margaret, after her grandmother. But if it’s a boy, we plan to name him Fredrick. No particular reason except that we both like the name.</p>
<p>　　Anyway, I would like to wish you both a long and happy life together and hope to come to see you as soon as Wendy is well enough.</p>
<p>　　Have a wonderful day and don’t forget to send us some photographs.</p>
<p>　　Cheers for now,<br>　　Ken and Wendy</p>

<p>　　Dear Bob,<br>　　How are you? I haven’t seen you for a while. Hope all is well. Anyway, I’m writing because I’m inviting some friends over for dinner and I thought you might also like to join us.</p>
<p>　　The dinner will be at my place, next Wednesday at 7 o’clock. Mary is doing the cooking, which I’m sure you’ll be pleased to learn. I’ll be taking care of the bar.</p>
<p>　　I’ve enclosed a map of how to get to our new apartment. It’s a little out of the way, I’m afraid, but we’ve got a spare room and you’re welcome to stay for the night if you wish. In fact, there’s an exhibitionon at the museum, so we can go and take a look on Thursday. One request, though: bring your majiang with you so that we can play after dinner.</p>
<p>　　Anyway, do let me know if you can make it. My new number’s at the top of the page, so you can give me a call sometime.</p>
<p>　　Take care and see you soon.<br>　　Ken</p>

Write a special letter to express your thanks.</strong><br>　<br>　　Dear Sue,<br>　　I am writing to <strong>express my heartfelt gratitude to you for</strong> your kindest help when I was involved in that terrible traffic accident. </p>
<p>　　You saw how seriously I had been hurt when you rushed me to the hospital. I was hit from the back by a taxi and was thrown forward for at least three meters. Though I did not lose my consciousness, the sharp pain was really killing me. If it had not been for your <strong>timely assistance</strong>, giving me first aid and sent me to hospital right away, I fear that the consequences might have been much more serious.</p>
<p>　　The doctor said that my wounds are healing quickly and that I would be able to stand up again in a week’s time. In addition, the taxi company has agreed to pay my hospital bills.</p>
<p>　　Anyway, everyone agrees that it was your quick-witted response in this emergency that has led to this satisfactory result. I feel I owe you so much, so please accept my most sincere thanks.</p>
<p>　　Best wishes,<br>　　Ken</p>
